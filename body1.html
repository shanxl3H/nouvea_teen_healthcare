                        <p>Body image refers to the way individuals perceive and evaluate their physical appearance. For teens, body image can be greatly influenced by societal and cultural norms and standards, as well as media and social media. The impact of body image on teens can extend beyond physical appearance and can also affect their overall mental health, self-esteem, relationships, and academic performance.</p>

                       <p>1. Challenge Negative Thoughts: When negative thoughts about your body arise, challenge them. Ask yourself if they are realistic or if they're influenced by your emotions.</p>
                       <p>2. Medication and Therapy: Depending on the disorder, medication, therapy or a combination of both may be recommended. Stick to your treatment plan and communicate regularly with your healthcare provider about your progress.</p>
                       <p>3. Focus on Health, Not Appearance: Shift your focus from appearance to health. Engage in activities that promote physical and mental well-being, such as regular exercise, nutritious eating, and sufficient sleep</p>
                       <p>4. Practice Mindfulness: Incorporate mindfulness techniques into your daily routine. Mindfulness can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment, allowing you to respond to them in a more balanced way.</p>
                       <p>5. Surround Yourself with Supportive People: Surround yourself with friends and family who support you and make you feel good about yourself. Avoid relationships that are centered around appearance or judgment.</p>

                       <p>6. Challenge Societal Norms: Recognize that societal beauty standards are often unrealistic and arbitrary. Challenge these norms and celebrate diversity in body shapes, sizes, and appearances.</p>
                       <p>7. Engage in Self-Care Activities: Take time for self-care activities that make you feel good about yourself. This could include hobbies, relaxation techniques, or pampering yourself in ways that have nothing to do with appearance.</p>
                       <p>8. Seek Professional Help: Consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who specializes in body image issues. They can provide you with coping strategies and techniques to improve your relationship with your body.</p>
                       <p>9. Practice Gratitude: Focus on the things your body allows you to do rather than its appearance. Practice gratitude for your body's strength, resilience, and functionality.</p>
                       <p>10. Set Goals: Set realistic and achievable goals for yourself that are not solely based on appearance. Focus on personal growth, learning new skills, and building meaningful relationships rather than changing your body to fit a certain ideal.</p>

                        <p>Eating disorders can be caused by a combination of genetic, psychological, social, and environmental factors. Genetics may play a role in predisposing individuals to certain eating disorders, while psychological factors such as low self-esteem, perfectionism, and body image issues can contribute to their development. Social pressures, such as cultural ideals of beauty and societal expectations, can also influence eating behaviors. Environmental factors like stress, trauma, and dysfunctional family dynamics can further contribute to the onset of eating disorders. It's important to address these factors comprehensively in treatment to support recovery.</p>

                   <div class="col-md-5 mt-5 mb-5">
                       <p>6. Avoid Triggers: Identify triggers that contribute to your disordered eating behaviors and try to avoid or minimize exposure to them. This might include certain social situations, environments, or types of media.</p>
                       <p>7. Practice Mindfulness: Mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, can help you stay present and manage anxiety or stress without turning to disordered eating behaviors.</p>
